# DIY-Lord-of-the-Rings-Stories

What if I created a site that lets you play as Frodo from Lord of the Rings but lets you explore alternate choices/timelines?
- What if Frodo has given Aragorn the ring in the shire?
- https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/p4f3bb/lord_of_the_rings_what_if/


Some planning steps:
1. Simple wiki of LOTR
2. Display story using wiki in some sort of visual format
3. Identify 1 key moment in story and choose 3 options of how that moment might be different. Finetune how those moments play out in text, visual, etc
